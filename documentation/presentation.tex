	\begin{frame}{Overview}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Context}: Fantasy Football team selection via \emph{inverse optimization}.
			\item \textbf{Methodologies}: Metaheuristics (PSO, DE, ES).
			\item \textbf{Objective}: Balance budget, positions, and performance to achieve the best score.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}

	\begin{frame}{Introduction}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Fantasy Football involves managing teams under budget and positional constraints.
			\item \emph{Inverse Optimization} adapts the scoring function based on historical data.
			\item A multi-manager auction is used for player assignments.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}
	
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\begin{frame}{Theoretical Background}
		\begin{block}{Inverse Optimization}
			Adjusting the cost/reward function so that observed solutions appear near-optimal.
		\end{block}
		\begin{block}{Metaheuristics}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item \textbf{PSO}: Inspired by swarm behavior.
				\item \textbf{DE}: Evolves solutions using vector differences.
				\item \textbf{ES}: Uses Gaussian mutations with selection strategies.
			\end{itemize}
		\end{block}
	\end{frame}
	
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\begin{frame}[fragile]{Scoring Function and Fitness Logic}
		\textbf{Player Scoring Function:} Computes the score based on:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Goals, assists, yellow/red cards, rating, and penalties.
		\end{itemize}
		\vspace{0.5em}
		\textbf{Fitness Function:} Evaluates a bid vector with penalties for:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Exceeding budget, unbalanced positions, etc.
		\end{itemize}
		\vspace{0.5em}
		\textbf{Example Code:}
		\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=score_player in utils.py]
			def score_player(player):
			goals = getattr(player, 'goals_scored', 0)
			assists = getattr(player, 'assists', 0)
			yellow_cards = getattr(player, 'yellow_cards', 0)
			red_cards = getattr(player, 'red_cards', 0)
			rating = getattr(player, 'fantasy_rating', 6.0)
			penalties = getattr(player, 'penalties_scored', 0)
			
			score = (0.5 * goals +
			0.2 * assists -
			0.05 * yellow_cards -
			0.1 * red_cards +
			0.2 * rating +
			0.2 * penalties)
			
			return score
		\end{lstlisting}
	\end{frame}
	
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\begin{frame}[fragile]{Manager Strategies}
		Each manager uses a metaheuristic to generate bids:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{PSO}: Using the \texttt{pyswarm} library.
			\item \textbf{DE}: Using \texttt{scipy.optimize.differential\_evolution}.
			\item \textbf{ES}: Implemented via \texttt{deap}.
		\end{itemize}
		\vspace{0.5em}
		\textbf{PSO Strategy Example:}
		\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=manager_strategy_pso]
			def manager_strategy_pso(manager, players_not_assigned):
			# Define lower and upper bounds for bids
			lb = np.zeros(len(players_not_assigned))
			ub = np.full(len(players_not_assigned), max_bid_per_player)
			
			# Define fitness function for PSO
			best_bids, _ = pso(fitness_func, lb, ub, swarmsize=40, maxiter=80)
			
			# Round bids to integers
			return [int(round(b)) for b in best_bids]
		\end{lstlisting}
	\end{frame}
	
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\begin{frame}{Multi-Manager Auction and Forced Assignments}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Auction Process}: Each manager submits bids for unassigned players.
			\item \textbf{Conflict Resolution}: The player is assigned to the highest bidder.
			\item \textbf{Forced Assignments}: If position minimums are not met, players are assigned at a base cost.
		\end{itemize}
